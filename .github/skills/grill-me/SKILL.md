  Use when user wants to stress-test a plan, get grilled on their design, or
  mentions "grill me". Developer-only utility — does not query the Theseus KG.
  For govcon-specific grilling (bid strategy, capture gate, boss prep), use the
  govcon grill-me skills instead.

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.
