# Skill Taxonomy — Three-Axis Classification

**Status:** Authoritative (Phase 4j, branch `135-phase-4j-skill-taxonomy`).
**Audience:** Skill authors, UI implementers, extraction-prompt maintainers,
agents discovering skills programmatically.
**Companion docs:** [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md), [skills_roadmap.md](skills_roadmap.md),
[SKILL_SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md](SKILL_SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md).

## 1. Why three axes (not one, not free-form tags)

Skills answer different questions for different people. A flat `category`
field collapses them to one dimension; free-form tags drift. We adopt
three orthogonal axes so the same skill catalog can be sliced for
discovery without misclassification:

| Axis             | Question it answers                  | Discovery surface                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `personas_*`     | **Who you are** on the capture team  | Sidebar grouping (primary) + "also for…" badge  |
| `shipley_phases` | **When in the lifecycle** you'll use | Filter pill row at top of skills page           |
| `capability`     | **What action** you need right now   | Filter pill row + command-palette quick-routing |

Each axis is closed-vocabulary: unknown values fail the contract test in
[tests/skills/test_skill_taxonomy.py](../tests/skills/test_skill_taxonomy.py).
Adding a new value requires updating this doc, the contract test, the
extraction prompt (for personas), and any UI filter chips in the same PR.

## 2. Persona vocabulary (8 IDs + `none`)

Mirrors the persona list in
[prompts/extraction/govcon_lightrag_native.txt](../prompts/extraction/govcon_lightrag_native.txt)
verbatim. **If a persona is added/removed there, update both files in the
same commit.** Cross-Cutting Change Checklist item 7 enforces this.

| ID                  | Shipley role             | What they need                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capture_manager`   | Capture Manager          | Win themes, hot buttons, discriminators, competitor reads |
| `proposal_manager`  | Proposal Manager         | Compliance matrices, outlines, Section L↔M traceability   |
| `proposal_writer`   | Proposal Writer          | Requirement details, FAB chains, narrative drafts         |
| `cost_estimator`    | Cost Estimator / Pricer  | BOEs, wrap rates, PTW, workload drivers                   |
| `contracts_manager` | Contracts / Subcontracts | FAR/DFARS clauses, terms, CLINs, sub SOWs                 |
| `technical_sme`     | Technical SME            | Performance standards, specs, QA criteria                 |
| `legal_compliance`  | Legal / Compliance       | OCI sweeps, certs/reps, IP terms, regulatory obligations  |
| `program_manager`   | Program Manager          | CDRLs, deliverable schedules, milestones, post-award      |
| `none`              | (utility / meta)         | No persona — skill serves any agent (renderers, ontology) |

`personas_primary` is required (one ID). `personas_secondary` is optional
(zero or more IDs). `none` may only appear as `personas_primary`; it is
never a secondary.

---

## 3. Shipley phase vocabulary (6 phases)

Six phases of the Shipley Business Development Lifecycle. A skill MAY
span multiple phases (e.g., `price-to-win` works in capture AND
proposal-development). `shipley_phases` is a list; empty list means
"phase-agnostic utility".

| Phase                  | Trigger                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pursuit`              | Pre-RFP qualification, opportunity ID, gate reviews                   |
| `capture`              | Customer engagement, competitive analysis, teaming, PWin shaping      |
| `strategy`             | Win strategy, theme development, solution architecting, color reviews |
| `proposal_development` | Outline, write, review, produce, submit                               |
| `negotiation`          | FPR, clarifications, BAFO, post-submission Q&A                        |
| `post_award`           | Kickoff, transition, CDRL execution, modifications, recompete prep    |

---

## 4. Capability vocabulary (7 verbs, closed)

What the skill **does**, in one verb. Used for command-palette quick
routing ("[draft] for [proposal_manager] in [proposal_development]").

| Verb       | Action                                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `research` | Gathers from external sources (MCPs, web, USAspending, eCFR)            |
| `analyze`  | Examines KG / documents, produces findings, no new prose                |
| `draft`    | Produces narrative artifacts for proposals (outlines, sections, SOWs)   |
| `audit`    | Validates against rules / regulations / OCI / compliance matrices       |
| `estimate` | Produces quantitative models (cost stacks, PTW, workload rollups)       |
| `render`   | Converts structured content to deliverable formats (DOCX/XLSX/PDF/PPTX) |
| `meta`     | Operates on other skills or the ontology itself                         |

---

## 5. Frontmatter shape

Added to the existing `metadata:` block — **flat keys, no new top-level
YAML fields** (the in-tree YAML parser at
[src/skills/manager.py](../src/skills/manager.py) accepts only one level
of nesting under `metadata:`, and we keep it that way for spec
portability across Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot).

```yaml
---
name: price-to-win
description: …
license: MIT
metadata:
  # — Phase 4j taxonomy —
  personas_primary: cost_estimator
  personas_secondary: [capture_manager]
  shipley_phases: [capture, strategy, proposal_development]
  capability: estimate
  # — existing pre-4j keys, unchanged —
  runtime: tools
  category: pricing
  version: 0.2.0
  status: active
  mcps: [bls_oews, gsa_calc, gsa_perdiem]
---
```

Notes:

- `personas_primary` is a **scalar** string. `personas_secondary` and
  `shipley_phases` are **lists** (use `[a, b]` inline form for ≤3 items,
  block form for longer lists).
- `capability` is a single string.
- All four keys are required for skills with `personas_primary != none`.
  Utility skills (`personas_primary: none`) MAY omit `shipley_phases` (or
  leave it `[]`) but must still declare `capability`.
- The existing `category` key is **not removed** — it survives as a
  short, free-form badge for the card UI. Taxonomy axes drive grouping
  and filtering; `category` is decoration.

## 7. UI consumption pattern

The skills page in [src/ui/static/index.html](../src/ui/static/index.html)
groups cards by `personas_primary` (one section header per persona ID,
plus a "Utility" section for `none`). At the top of the page, two pill
rows let the user filter the visible set:

- **Phase pills** — toggleable; click multiple to OR-filter.
- **Capability pills** — toggleable; click multiple to OR-filter.

When a card has `personas_secondary`, those personas surface as small
"also relevant for: …" tags on the card itself.

## 8. Cross-cutting change discipline

Updating any vocabulary in this doc requires (per Cross-Cutting Change
Checklist item 7 in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](../.github/copilot-instructions.md)):

1. Update this doc's vocabulary table(s).
2. Update `prompts/extraction/govcon_lightrag_native.txt` Part B persona
   list (for `personas_*` changes only).
3. Bump every affected SKILL.md frontmatter in the same commit.
4. Update [tests/skills/test_skill_taxonomy.py](../tests/skills/test_skill_taxonomy.py)
   enums.
5. Update UI filter pills in `index.html` (and Tailwind class allowlist
   if a new persona needs a new color).
6. Run `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/skills/ -v` and
   confirm the contract tests still pass.

No PR that adds/removes a persona, phase, or capability lands without
all six steps.
