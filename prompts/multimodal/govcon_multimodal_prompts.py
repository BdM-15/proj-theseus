Government Contracting Multimodal Prompts for RAGAnything (v2.0)

Registered via register_prompt_language("govcon", GOVCON_MULTIMODAL_PROMPTS)
then activated with set_prompt_language("govcon").

These replace RAGAnything's generic data-analyst prompts with federal acquisition
expertise across all multimodal content types: tables, images, and equations.

Ontology alignment: Prompts reference the canonical govcon entity types and canonical
relationship types defined in src/ontology/schema.py and the extraction prompt
(prompts/extraction/govcon_lightrag_json.txt). This ensures VLM output primes
downstream entity/relationship extraction with correct vocabulary.

Shipley methodology: Prompts surface strategic signals (discriminators, hot buttons,
compliance matrix mapping, FAB chain proof points) so multimodal content feeds the
same Shipley intelligence pipeline as text extraction.

Key govcon knowledge encoded here:
- Table analysis: workload drivers, CLINs, deliverables, shall/must/will requirements,
  multi-page continuation detection, Appendix/Section location awareness,
  evaluation hierarchy (factor/subfactor/element metadata), Shipley strategic signals
- Image analysis: org charts, facility layouts, CDRL hierarchies, evaluation frameworks,
  organizational relationships using canonical relationship types
- Equation analysis: performance formulas, incentive calculations, AQL thresholds
- Query analysis: federal acquisition framing for VLM-enhanced queries
- JSON contract: exact structure required by TableModalProcessor._parse_table_response
  and ImageModalProcessor._parse_response (detailed_description + entity_info)
