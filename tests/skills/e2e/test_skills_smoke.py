"""Parametrized smoke test for every installed skill.

For each skill the server reports as installed, this test:

1. Picks a representative prompt (from the skill's own ``evals/evals.json``
   first entry; falls back to a per-skill default below).
2. Invokes the skill via the HTTP API.
3. Asserts the tool loop completed without erroring.
4. Asserts the response is non-empty.
5. Asserts grounding signals: at least one of (a) a chunk-id citation in the
   response, (b) ``entities_used`` non-empty in the envelope, (c) a non-empty
   transcript with KG retrieval calls (probed via the run-detail endpoint).

Skills that emit a deliverable (artifact) get an additional check that the
``run_dir/artifacts/`` directory was populated.

When ``RUN_GROUNDING_AUDIT=1`` is set, each skill's transcript is also fed
through ``tools/audit_skill_grounding.py`` and a grounding ratio is logged.
With ``ENFORCE_GROUNDING_RATIO=1`` (off by default) the run hard-fails any
skill below ``MIN_GROUNDING_RATIO`` (default 0.80); without it, sub-threshold
ratios are recorded as ``xfail`` while citation rules are tightened.

The harness is intentionally permissive on response *content* — branch 147
adds the quantified grounding-ratio audit. This branch only proves the loop
runs end-to-end + the audit infrastructure works.
