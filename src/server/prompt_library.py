# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Suggested prompt library (Shipley phases 3-6)
#
# Design rules:
#  - Pattern-based, not keyword-based: prompts assume Theseus has indexed the
#    RFP's structure (sections, requirements, eval criteria, deliverables) and
#    refer to those abstractions rather than literal headings.
#  - Agnostic: no company, customer, agency, or program names. Use neutral
#    placeholders like {topic}, {section_or_task}, {capability}, {discriminator},
#    {requirement_id}, {volume_or_section}.
#  - Adaptable: each prompt works against any RFP the user has loaded into the
#    active workspace.
#  - Shipley-aligned: phases mirror Shipley capture/proposal lifecycle phases
#    3 (Capture), 4 (Planning), 5 (Development), 6 (Color Reviews & Submittal).

     "prompt": "Generate a full proposal-instruction ↔ evaluation-factor compliance matrix. For every proposal_instruction (UCF Section L or equivalent — non-UCF task orders, FOPRs, BPA calls, OTAs may name the section differently or embed instructions inline in the PWS), list the linked evaluation_factor (UCF Section M or equivalent — including adjectival or LPTA schemes), the responsible proposal volume, page-limit constraints, and any unmatched items as gaps. Tag each row with instruction_source (UCF-L | non-UCF | PWS-inline | attachment) and evaluation_source (UCF-M | non-UCF | adjectival | LPTA).

     "prompt": "Create a proposal cross-reference matrix with nine columns: Section Number, Section Title, Proposal Instructions, Evaluation Criteria, SOW/PWS, Other, Author, Pages, Status. Populate Section Number/Title from the proposal outline implied by the proposal_instruction entities, the Proposal Instructions column from those proposal_instruction entities (UCF Section L or equivalent), the Evaluation Criteria column from the evaluation_factor entities (UCF Section M or equivalent), and the SOW/PWS column from the statement-of-work paragraphs.

     "prompt": "Identify candidate win themes, discriminators, and proof points implied by the indexed RFP. Map each to the customer priority or pain point it addresses, and to the evaluation factor it would influence. Distinguish true discriminators (likely unique to us) from table stakes."},
    {"phase": "4", "category": "Strategy", "title": "Solution architecture brief",
     "prompt": "Sketch a solution architecture brief: technical approach pillars, management approach pillars, staffing model assumptions, transition approach, and risk mitigations.

    {"phase": "4", "category": "Risk", "title": "Risk register & mitigations",
     "prompt": "Build a risk register from the RFP: technical, schedule, cost, transition, security, supply-chain, and integration risks.

    {"phase": "4", "category": "Risk", "title": "Detailed project risk assessment",
     "prompt": "Perform a detailed risk assessment for the as-bid solution. Categorize risks as technical, financial, operational, strategic, and compliance. For each risk: probability (L/M/H), impact severity (L/M/H), risk score (probability × impact), specific mitigation strategies, required resources for mitigation, and the responsible owner. Format the output as a prioritized risk matrix with recommended actions."},
    {"phase": "4", "category": "Risk", "title": "Vague-language / scrutiny risk scan",
     "prompt": "Review the indexed scope/PWS for vague, consultative, or non-outcome-based language (assess, analyze, support, recommendations, strategic planning, evaluating, developing models, conducting research). Compute a high-risk-verbiage percentage = (high-risk term occurrences / total word count) × 100. Classify: >4% Critical, 2.5-4% High, 1-2.5% Moderate, <1% Low. Then compute a positive-verbiage percentage for outcome-based terms (readiness, capability, mission, deliverable, performance) using the same formula. Surface the most concerning paragraphs for rewrite or risk-section coverage."},

For each volume, list its sections, the page budget derived from the relevant proposal_instruction entities (UCF Section L or equivalent), the evaluation_factor entities it must answer (UCF Section M or equivalent — including adjectival or LPTA schemes), and the win theme(s) it should carry."},
    {"phase": "5", "category": "Writing", "title": "Executive summary intro (pain → value prop)",
     "prompt": "Write the executive summary introduction by opening with the customer's most painful problem (framed as a burning question), then present our value proposition as the solution to that problem, then introduce our win theme and the relevant capabilities that prove we can deliver.

    {"phase": "5", "category": "Writing", "title": "Executive summary full draft",
     "prompt": "Draft a full executive summary: open with the customer's mission challenge, state our solution promise, surface three discriminators each backed by a quantified proof point, and close with a benefit-anchored call to action. Stay within the page limit imposed by the relevant proposal_instruction entities (UCF Section L or equivalent — may live inline in the PWS or in a named attachment for non-UCF solicitations); default to 4 pages if no limit is stated."},
    {"phase": "5", "category": "Writing", "title": "Section storyboard",
     "prompt": "Storyboard a single proposal section: the proposal_instruction it answers (UCF Section L or equivalent), the evaluation_factor entities it earns (UCF Section M or equivalent), the win theme it carries, the proof points it cites, the graphic concepts, and the action caption for each graphic.

Step 3 (Who): a sentence (with placeholder for names) describing who performs the work and their roles. Step 4 (How): paragraphs diving into implementation detail, mapped to the relevant statement-of-work paragraphs. Step 5 (When/Where): schedule and place-of-performance integration.

    {"phase": "5", "category": "Writing", "title": "RFI question response",
     "prompt": "Respond to the RFI question: '{requirement_text}'. Use the indexed past-performance and capability content.

     "prompt": "For our most defensible discriminator, write a Feature → Advantage → Benefit chain grounded in cited proof points and tied to the relevant evaluation_factor (UCF Section M or equivalent) and customer hot button."},
    {"phase": "5", "category": "Strategy", "title": "Strength & benefit identification (eval-anchored)",
     "prompt": "Identify 3-4 strengths in our draft that meet the formal definition: 'an aspect of the proposal that has merit or exceeds specified requirements in a way advantageous to the government during contract performance.' For each strength: name the unique capability/method/technology, cite the proposal text, tie it to the specific evaluation_factor it influences (UCF Section M or equivalent — including adjectival or LPTA schemes), and articulate the quantifiable benefit (positive outcome) the customer gains. A benefit must be tangible, tied to evaluation criteria, and not merely 'potential value.'"},
    {"phase": "5", "category": "Strategy", "title": "Strength/benefit conciseness rewrite",
     "prompt": "Rewrite the provided strengths and benefits to be clear, concise, and table-cell-sized while preserving every quantitative claim and tie-back to evaluation criteria.

    {"phase": "5", "category": "Risk", "title": "Risk to operations from requirements",
     "prompt": "Identify and describe requirements that may pose a risk to operations after award.

    {"phase": "6", "category": "Review", "title": "Pink team feedback prompts",
     "prompt": "Generate Pink team review prompts for each volume: are win themes visible, are discriminators substantiated with cited proof, are graphics earning their space (action captions tied to themes), is compliance language unambiguous, are FAB chains complete, is the customer's mission outcome the subject of the verbs?"},
    {"phase": "6", "category": "Review", "title": "Red team challenge questions",
     "prompt": "Generate Red team challenge questions a tough source-selection evaluator would ask. For each: point to the proposal section that should answer it and the specific proof point that should land it. Flag questions our current draft cannot answer."},
    {"phase": "6", "category": "Review", "title": "Red team rewrite (Shipley expert)",
     "prompt": "Act as a Shipley-process expert performing a Red team review. For each response: provide detailed strengths, detailed weaknesses, and specific recommendations. Then provide a rewritten version of the answer that incorporates the recommendations. The rewrite must use active voice, mirror the existing response tone, reference appropriate doctrine where relevant, avoid blustery or overly complex language, avoid language patterns that signal LLM-generated text, and avoid em-dashes/en-dashes. Recommendations must be unbiased and worded as recommendations (not as commitments we are making)."},
    {"phase": "6", "category": "Review", "title": "Gold team executive narrative check",
     "prompt": "Read the executive summary and management volume openers as a Gold team would. Flag any place the customer's mission outcome is not the subject of the verbs, where benefits are not quantified, where discriminators read as table stakes, or where compliance language is missing."},
    {"phase": "6", "category": "Review", "title": "Gap analysis vs evaluation factors",
     "prompt": "Run a gap analysis: for each evaluation_factor and subfactor (UCF Section M or equivalent — including adjectival or LPTA schemes), list the proposal sections, deliverables, and proof points that respond to it. Highlight unanswered factors, weakly-answered factors, and factors answered in the wrong volume."},

     "prompt": "Generate a Pink/Red-team-executable compliance review checklist organized by proposal_instruction (UCF Section L or equivalent), with the matching evaluation_factor pass/fail criteria (UCF Section M or equivalent), the responsible volume, and a column for reviewer pass/fail/comment."},
    {"phase": "6", "category": "Review", "title": "Strengths & benefits enhancement review",
     "prompt": "Review the draft strength table. For each row: assess whether the strength is genuinely advantageous to the customer (not just a feature), whether the benefit is tied to evaluation criteria, and whether the language is clear and concise. Provide specific suggestions: quantify outcomes, tighten unique-capability language, add a brief success story, detail forward benefits, and (if available) cite a customer testimonial. Output a revised, table-ready version."},
    {"phase": "6", "category": "Review", "title": "Reflect on win strategy",
     "prompt": "Review the win strategies and themes we've adopted. Identify any risks we haven't considered, opportunities we haven't pursued, competitor counter-moves we haven't anticipated, and proof gaps that would weaken the strategy under Red-team scrutiny."},
    {"phase": "6", "category": "Submission", "title": "Final compliance sweep",
     "prompt": "Final pre-submission sweep: confirm every proposal_instruction (UCF Section L or equivalent) is answered, every evaluation_factor (UCF Section M or equivalent — including adjectival or LPTA schemes) is addressed, every page limit is met, every required artifact (volumes, certifications, reps & certs, pricing, model contract, oral slides) is named, every cross-reference is intact, and every page footer/header complies with format constraints."},
