Capture Management Knowledge Module

Evergreen knowledge about capture strategy:
- Bid/No-Bid decision frameworks
- Win theme development
- Customer hot buttons and discriminators
- Competitive positioning
- Pwin calculation

Entity types: strategic_theme, concept
Source: Shipley methodology, APMP, industry best practices

Note: These are FRAMEWORKS and APPROACHES, not specific capture plans.
RFP-specific capture intelligence comes from document extraction.

# =============================================================================
# THESEUS SCOPE CONTRACT
# =============================================================================
# Theseus is a Shipley **Phase 4-6** system (Proposal Planning → Proposal
# Development → Post-Submittal Activities), activated AFTER the Final RFP is
# received and the Bid Validation Decision is made.
#
# The entities in this module describe **Shipley Phase 0-3** activities
# (Market Segmentation → Long-Term Positioning → Opportunity Assessment →
# Capture/Opportunity Planning) that PRECEDE the Theseus engagement window.
# Phase 3 (Capture/Opportunity Planning) ends at the Bid Validation Decision
# gate; Phase 4 (Proposal Planning) begins immediately after.
#
# Role of these entities when an RFP is active:
#   1. TERMINOLOGY RECOGNITION — the mentor recognizes "Pwin", "PTW",
#      "Black Hat", "Capture Plan" when the user references them
#   2. UPSTREAM INPUT REFERENCE — the Capture Plan is the *source* of
#      win themes, discriminators, and PTW targets that Phase 4-6
#      proposal work operationalizes
#   3. POST-AWARD LEARNING LOOP — Win/Loss Analysis feeds *future*
#      captures, not the in-flight proposal
#
# What the mentor should NOT do while an RFP is being processed:
#   - Proactively raise Bid/No-Bid, Pwin recalibration, opportunity
#     shaping, customer call planning, or teaming renegotiation. Those
#     decisions are already made; the user is writing the proposal.
#   - Suggest protest strategy or debrief prep during drafting.
#   - Redirect a proposal-writing question into capture strategy.
#
# Future scope: A separate evergreen pre-RFP (Phase 0-3) Theseus mode
# could surface these entities proactively — that is not the current
# product and is not the default mentor behavior today.
