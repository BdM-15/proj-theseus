GovCon Domain Ontology Knowledge Modules

Modular architecture for evergreen domain knowledge:
- Each module exports ENTITIES and RELATIONSHIPS lists
- govcon_kg.py consolidates all modules into single custom_kg dict
- bootstrap.py injects consolidated KG into LightRAG via insert_custom_kg()

Module Categories:
- shipley.py: Shipley BD Lifecycle, Color Teams, Capture Tools
- regulations.py: FAR/DFARS compliance patterns
- evaluation.py: Rating methodologies, scoring approaches
- workload.py: BOE formulas, staffing ratios
- capture.py: Bid/No-Bid, Win Themes, Discriminators
- lessons_learned.py: 20+ years domain expertise
- company_capabilities.py: Company-specific service lines, platforms, past performance, discriminators

Entity types align with schema.py (33 govcon types) for seamless merging.
