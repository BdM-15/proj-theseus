"""
Company Capabilities Knowledge Module — KBR

Company-specific entities representing KBR's actual service lines, named
proprietary platforms, accreditations, and past performance heritage.

GROUNDING PRINCIPLE: Every entity in this module must be substantiable from
public KBR sources (kbr.com, solutions.kbr.com, SAM.gov contract awards, USASpending,
public press releases). No marketing hype, no aspirational capabilities.

APPLICABILITY: This module is most useful when the ingested RFP falls inside
KBR's actual addressable market:
  - DoD/Federal sustainment, base operations, contingency support (LOGCAP/AFCAP heritage)
  - Space Force / Air Force C2 and SDA (Iron Stallion incumbent at USSF)
  - Federal cloud / FedRAMP High / IL5 environments (Vaault)
  - DoD ISR / autonomy / UAS (Artemis, Skypath, TTMT)
  - Industrial/installation O&M and digital twin (ENCOMPASS, INSITE, IAM)
  - Cyber test/training ranges (Cyber Range, CRYSTALVISTA)

When overlayed on an RFP outside these lanes, the bootstrapped entities will
still load but produce few useful inferred relationships against extracted
RFP entities — that is the correct, honest behavior.

CUSTOMIZE: Items marked with TODO are placeholders that require company-internal
data (specific CAGE codes, current CMMC level, named key personnel, current
GSA schedule numbers, exact CPARS ratings) before use in proposal generation.

Entity types used: organization, concept, technology, compliance_artifact,
program, past_performance_reference, strategic_theme
