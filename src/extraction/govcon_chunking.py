"""
GovCon document classification + banner injection at chunk time.

NON-INVASIVE: Wraps LightRAG's native ``chunking_by_token_size``. No library
patches, no monkey patches, no RAGAnything internals touched.

This is registered via ``global_args.chunking_func`` in ``src/server/config.py``,
which is LightRAG's documented extension point for custom chunking. The same
seam was already in use for the default chunker — we just substitute a
classifier-decorated version.

How it works
------------
1. LightRAG hands us the full post-parse content (MinerU output for PDFs,
   raw text for .txt/.md, normalized text for .docx/.xlsx) for each document.
2. We classify the document by inspecting filename echoes, section headers,
   and structural signals (e.g., repeating ``$0.00`` placeholder rows).
3. We call the native ``chunking_by_token_size`` to produce token-bounded
   chunks — identical behavior to the default path.
4. We prepend a single-line ``[GOVCON_DOC: type=...; note=...]`` banner to
   every chunk's ``content``. The banner is:

   - embedded into the chunk's vector (so retrieval surfaces template
     context whenever a template chunk is returned),
   - present in the LLM's context window during entity extraction (so the
     extractor can suppress placeholder values from becoming entities),
   - present in the LLM's context window during query response (the
     mentor prompt's Section 3a uses this to apply template guardrails).

5. We also stash ``govcon_doc_type`` on the chunk dict for any downstream
   code that wants the structured tag (LightRAG ignores unknown keys).

Doc types
---------
* ``solicitation`` — RFP, RFQ, FOPR, solicitation memorandum, Section L/M
* ``pws``          — Performance Work Statement, SOW, SOO
* ``cdrl_exhibit`` — CDRL list, Exhibit A, DD Form 1423
* ``template``     — Customer-provided fillable template (CLIN cost estimate,
  staffing matrix, Q&A submission form, past-performance reference form).
  Numeric values are offeror placeholders; structure is normative.
* ``unknown``      — Could not classify; no banner is added.
