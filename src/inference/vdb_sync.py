"""
VDB Sync Module - Syncs algorithm-discovered relationships to LightRAG VDBs

Issue #65: P0 - Critical architecture gap fix

PROBLEM:
The 8 semantic post-processing algorithms discover relationships and write them
to Neo4j only. LightRAG's VDBs (entity_vdb, relationships_vdb) are NOT updated.
This means agent queries via /query endpoint miss algorithm discoveries.

SOLUTION:
After algorithm execution completes, sync the new relationships back to LightRAG
using the native insert_custom_kg() method. This updates:
- relationships_vdb: For relationship-based retrieval
- Entity descriptions: For better entity retrieval

ARCHITECTURE:
    Document → LightRAG extraction → VDBs updated ✅
                    ↓
             Neo4j sync
                    ↓
             8 Algorithms discover relationships → Neo4j updated ✅
                    ↓
             sync_discoveries_to_vdb() → VDBs UPDATED ✅  ← NEW
                    ↓
             Queries NOW FIND algorithm discoveries ✅
